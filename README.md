# To-supply-leftover-food-to-poor
This project aims to collect and distribute leftover food from restaurants, events, and households to poor and needy people. It helps reduce food waste while fighting hunger in the community. Through proper storage and timely delivery, we ensure safe and nutritious meals reach those in need.
